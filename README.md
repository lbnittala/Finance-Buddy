A single page overview summarizing a project concept:
Problem Domain: Finance Buddy (Finance management)
Problem Description: Young adults frequently face difficulties managing their finances in order
to become financially independent, especially when it comes to paying credit card bills, loans,
and interest. These concerns are explained in this project. This program aims to lessen the
financial load on young people who take financial management seriously and who experience a
great deal of stress related to it. The goal of this project is to create a mobile application by
comprehending the problems and obstacles that young people have with money.
Project objective: Thissmartphone software aimsto relieve young people ofsome of the financial
strain and stress associated with managing their finances. A few of the tools that the
application provides to assist students in efficiently managing their financial resources include
the Expense Tracker, Financial Education Resources, Bill Payment Remainders, Security, and
Trend Analysis.
Expected results: The Finance Buddy App for Teens seeks to address the prevalent issue of poor
financial decision-making among teenagers by offering a comprehensive and engaging
educational platform. Recognizing that teens often lack fundamental financial information, the
app aims to bridge this knowledge gap through interactive learning modules, informative videos,
and quizzes, all conveniently integrated within the app. A crucial feature is the user-friendly
expenditure tracker, whichh enables teenagers to understand their spending patterns with
categorization, budgeting tools, and visual reports. To enhance user satisfaction and
effectiveness, the app's features and content are customizable, catering to the individual needs
and preferences of each user. To make financial activities more enjoyable and captivating, the app
integrates gamification elements such as leaderboards, badges, and rewards. Ultimately, the
Finance Buddy for Teens aims to empower young individuals to make wise financial decisions
and cultivate responsible financial habits through an interactive, tailored, and entertaining
learning experience.


Combining and picking the best features from the two prototypes, here is the final version. The user can
either sign up or log in using their credentials on the first page, which is the login page if they already have
an account. Users who have logged in will see a dashboard with several icons, such as the ones for trend
analysis, personalization, security, bill remainders and peer support. Users can select any icon based on
their needs and each icon leads to a different page. For instance, if you opt for Tracker, you can monitor
your credit card payments, online transactions, and physical bills. By choosing any of these options and
clicking "Continue," users are taken to a page where they can customize their dates and choose the
duration for which they want to view their bills, such as a week or a month. Users can now examine their
expenses based on the chosen time frame, as shown by a graph, and they can also see the status of their
payments, including whether they are pending or not. A credit score is also displayed, encouraging and
directing the customer according to their expenditures.
